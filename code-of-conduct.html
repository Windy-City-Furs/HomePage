    <h1>Code of Conduct</h1>

    <p>This Code of Conduct defines required behavior at Windy City Furmeets events. All attendees, organizers,
        volunteers, vendors, and sponsors must comply with these rules in all event spaces, both in person and
        online.</p>

    <p>Venue policies and applicable local laws also apply at all times. Our organizers are authorized to enforce this
        Code of Conduct and venue policies in coordination with venue staff and security.</p>

    <h2>Required Conduct</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Respect all individuals. Discrimination based on race, ethnicity, gender identity or expression, sexual
            orientation, disability, appearance, body size, age, religion, or personal background is not permitted.
        </li>
        <li>Obtain explicit consent before physical contact or photographing any attendee.</li>
        <li>Engage in discussions respectfully. Disruptive or aggressive behavior is prohibited.</li>

        <li>Follow all instructions from event organizers, staff, and venue personnel.</li>
        <li>Respect venue property and shared spaces.</li>
    </ul>

        <li>Encouraging or supporting any of the above behaviors.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Weapons Policy</h2>
    <p>No weapons of any kind are permitted, subject to venue policies. This includes firearms, explosives, large
        knives, or realistic prop weapons.</p>
    <p>Prop weapons may be permitted if they are pre-approved, peace-bonded, and comply with venue guidelines.
        Peace-bonding is the process of marking props to indicate they are safe and approved for event use.</p>
    <p>Event organizers and venue staff reserve the right to inspect and determine the suitability of any prop or item
        at their discretion. Any item deemed unsafe will need to be removed from the premises immediately.</p>

    <h2>Media & Photography Policy</h2>
    <p>Respect privacy at all times. Consent is required before photographing or recording individuals.</p>
    <p>Organizers may request removal of photos or videos that violate this policy. Violation of these guidelines may
        result in removal of the content and removal from the event.</p>
    <p>Community members with privacy concerns should notify organizers immediately. We will make reasonable efforts to
        accommodate such requests.</p>

    <h2>Enforcement & Accountability</h2>
    <p>Organizers are empowered to enforce this Code of Conduct at all times. Violations may result in verbal warnings,
        removal from the event without refund, or referral to local authorities. Serious or repeat violations will
        result in permanent bans from future events.</p>
    <p>Vendors and sponsors are expected to comply with this Code of Conduct. Violations by vendors or sponsors may
        result in removal from the event space and termination of participation without refund.</p>
    <p>Organizers coordinate with venue security and staff to ensure a safe environment. All reports and enforcement
        actions are handled with discretion.</p>

    <h2>Reporting Violations</h2>
    <p>Report violations immediately to any event organizer or staff member. Reports can be made in person or via our
        contact page. Reports will be addressed promptly and confidentially.</p>
    <p>Attendees, vendors, and venue staff are encouraged to report concerns directly to our organizers. Our reporting
        process is confidential, responsive, and respectful.</p>

    <h2>Appeals & Resolution</h2>
    <p>Appeals of enforcement decisions can be submitted to the event leadership team via our contact page. Appeals will
        be reviewed fairly, and decisions will be final.</p>
    <p>Windy City Furmeets organizers reserve the right to make final decisions regarding all matters of conduct,
        enforcement, and appeals to maintain the safety and integrity of the event.</p>

    <h2>Amendments</h2>
    <p>This Code of Conduct may be amended at any time. Updates will be communicated to attendees prior to or at the
        start of the event.</p>
