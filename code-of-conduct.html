    <h1>Code of Conduct</h1>

    <p>Windy City Furmeets is committed to building an inclusive, respectful, and welcoming space for attendees of all
        backgrounds. Our goal is to create events where everyone feels safe, valued, and free to express themselves
        without fear of discrimination or harassment.</p>

    <p>We work collaboratively with our venue hosts and vendors to maintain a safe and respectful environment. Our
        policies complement venue rules and local laws, and our team is prepared to enforce them responsibly.</p>

    <p>This Code of Conduct applies to all attendees, organizers, volunteers, vendors, and sponsors at our events, both
        in person and online. It defines our expectations for behavior and outlines the process for addressing concerns
        or violations.</p>

    <h2>Our Community Standards</h2>

    <p>Windy City Furmeets is dedicated to creating a safe, welcoming, and inclusive environment for everyone. Our community values respect, consent, and accountability. All participants are expected to uphold these standards to ensure a positive experience for all.</p>

    <p>Understand that the impact of your actions matters more than your intent. Even well-meaning behavior can cause harm. Listen to feedback, and adjust your actions to ensure a respectful environment.</p>

    <p>Take full responsibility for your alcohol or substance use. Follow all venue policies and applicable laws. Over-consumption or disruptive behavior will result in removal from the event. Our organizers work closely with venue staff to monitor and manage alcohol service responsibly.</p>

    <p>Respect venue staff, property, policies, and all applicable local laws and regulations.</p>

    <p>The following expectations apply to all participants:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Treat all individuals with respect, in both words and actions, regardless of race, ethnicity, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, age, religion, or personal background.</li>
        <li>Always obtain explicit consent before physical contact or photographing other attendees.</li>
        <li>Approach disagreements with constructive dialogue and a willingness to collaborate.</li>
        <li>Actively support a harassment-free environment where everyone can participate safely and fully.</li>
        <li>Be mindful of your presence in shared spaces and your impact on those around you.</li>
    </ul>



    <h2>Unacceptable Behavior</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Harassment of any kind, including offensive verbal comments, deliberate intimidation, stalking, or unwelcome
            attention.
        </li>
        <li>Non-consensual and unwanted physical contact or unwelcome sexual harassment.</li>
        <li>Hate speech, slurs, or any behavior that marginalizes another person or group.</li>
        <li>Sharing or threatening to share another person's private information (doxxing).</li>
        <li>Inappropriate or non-consensual photography or recording.</li>
        <li>Disruptive behavior of talks, presentations, or other event activities.</li>
        <li>Displaying of distributing, explicit, violent, or otherwise inappropriate materials in event spaces.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Weapons Policy</h2>
    <p>To maintain a safe environment, weapons of any kind are prohibited at our events, subject to the policies of our
        partner venues. This includes firearms, explosives, large knives, and realistic prop weapons.</p>
    <p>Prop weapons that are part of a costume may be permitted if they are pre-approved, peace-bonded, and comply with venue
        guidelines. Peace-bonding is the process of marking props to indicate they are safe and approved for event
        use.</p>
    <p>Event organizers and venue staff reserve the right to inspect and determine the suitability of any prop or item
        at their discretion. Any item deemed unsafe will need to be removed from the premises immediately.</p>

    <h2>Media & Photography Guidelines</h2>
    <p>We encourage attendees to capture and share positive moments from our events. However, please respect the privacy
        and consent of fellow participants at all times.</p>
    <p>Before publicly sharing photos or videos that include others, ask for their permission. While we cannot control
        public spaces, we expect our community to follow this standard of respect. If you are unsure, please check with
        event organizers.</p>
    <p>We also welcome anyone with privacy concerns to speak with organizers, and we will do our best to support and
        accommodate requests regarding media sharing.</p>

    <h2>Enforcement & Accountability</h2>
    <p>Event staff and organizers are empowered to enforce this Code of Conduct. Responses to violations may include
        verbal warnings, removal from the event without refund, or referral to local authorities if necessary.</p>
    <p>We work directly with venue security or staff as needed to uphold safety standards. All reports will be handled
        with discretion and care, with our priority being the safety and well-being of all participants.</p>

    <h2>Reporting a Concern</h2>
    <p>If you experience or witness behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, please report it to an organizer or
        designated event staff member immediately. Reports can be made in person or via our contact page. We are
        committed to addressing issues promptly and thoroughly.</p>
    <p>Attendees and venue staff are encouraged to report concerns directly to our organizers. Our reporting process is
        confidential, responsive, and respectful.</p>

    <h2>Appeals & Resolution</h2>
    <p>If you feel a decision regarding enforcement has been made in error, you may submit an appeal to the event
        leadership team via our contact page. All appeals will be reviewed fairly and carefully to ensure transparency
        and accountability.</p>
