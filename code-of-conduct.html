    <h2>No Solicitation Policy</h2>
    <p>
        To maintain the focus and integrity of our event and online channels, we enforce a strict no solicitation
        policy.
        Promotion, advertising, or selling of goods, services, or websites without prior approval from the organizers is
        strictly prohibited. Violators of this policy may be asked to cease their activities and could face removal from
        the event or online platform. If you wish to engage in promotional activities, please contact the organizers in
        advance to obtain the necessary permissions.
    </p>
    <h2>Weapons Policy</h2>
    <p>
        The hosting venue reserves the right to deny entry to any attendee based on non-compliance with the weapons
        policy or any other security concerns that may arise.
    </p>
    <p>
        Firearms, firearm replicas, and lookalike weapons, including but not limited to airsoft guns, foam replicas,
        toys
        like NERF guns, or models, are strictly prohibited within the venue or meet. This
        policy extends to all firearm types, replicas, and lookalikes, regardless of functionality. If it has the
        ability to create a projectile, it is not allowed
    </p>
    <p>
        The carrying of weapons, either functioning or non-functioning, openly or concealed, is not allowed at any time
        within venue or meet. This includes any item that could be easily mistaken for a
        weapon.
    </p>
    <p>
        Non-functioning, non-firearm prop weapon replicas may be allowed as part of a costume under certain conditions:
        These props must be crafted from safe, lightweight materials such as foam or cardboard and must not possess any
        sharp edges. The allowance of such props is at the discretion of the event staff and requires proper
        peace-bonding. For any clarifications, please refer to our contact us page prior to the event.
    </p>
    <h2>Media & Photography Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We encourage photography, recording, and social media sharing of content in public spaces as outlined in our
        Media & Photography Policy.
    </p>
    <p>Respect privacy at all times. Consent is required before photographing or recording individuals.</p>
    <p>
        Organizers may request removal of photos or videos that violate this policy. Violation of these guidelines may
        result in removal of the content and removal from the event.
    </p>
    <p>
        Community members with privacy concerns should notify organizers immediately. We will make reasonable efforts to
        accommodate such requests.
    </p>
    <h2>Enforcement & Accountability</h2>
    <p>
        Organizers are empowered to enforce this Code of Conduct at all times. Violations may result in verbal warnings,
        removal from the event without refund, or referral to local authorities. Serious or repeat violations will
        result in permanent bans from future events.
    </p>
    <p>
        Vendors and sponsors are expected to comply with this Code of Conduct. Violations by vendors or sponsors may
        result in removal from the event space and termination of participation without refund.
    </p>
    <p>
        Organizers coordinate with venue security and staff to ensure a safe environment. All reports and enforcement
        actions are handled with discretion.
    </p>
    <h2>Reporting Violations</h2>
    <p>
        Report violations immediately to any event organizer or staff member. Reports can be made in person or via our
        contact page. Reports will be addressed promptly and confidentially.
    </p>
    <p>
        Attendees, vendors, and venue staff are encouraged to report concerns directly to our organizers. Our reporting
        process is confidential, responsive, and respectful.
    </p>
    <h2>Appeals & Resolution</h2>
    <p>
        Appeals of enforcement decisions can be submitted to the event leadership team via our contact page. Appeals
        will
        be reviewed fairly, and decisions will be final.
    </p>
    <p>
        Windy City Furmeets organizers reserve the right to make final decisions regarding all matters of conduct,
        enforcement, and appeals to maintain the safety and integrity of the event.
    </p>
